Story Description
- There are many stray cats and dogs gathered under the sakura tree that Thoma saw.


(You meet Thoma under a Sakura tree)

Thoma: This is a pretty good spot, right?
Thoma: There are tons of stray cats and dogs here at the outskirts. Every time I come to Komore Teahouse, I bring some food for them.
Thoma: It just sort of became a tradition over time... at first it was a bit of a chore, but the more time I spent with them, the more I came to enjoy it.

You: They seem to like you a lot.
 
Thoma: You think so? Well, feed them enough times, and I'm sure you'll win their affection, too.
Thoma: Not only that, you'll also start to feel that they're your responsibility. Whenever you have any free time, you'll find yourself desperate to come and visit them.
Thoma: Why don't you try feeding them, (Traveler)?
Thoma: I brought some of their favorite food just so you can get into their good graces.

You: Okay, I guess I'll try.

Thoma: Don't worry, I've trained them to not be aggressive toward humans.
Thoma: They'll still run away if they find someone threatening, but I'm pretty sure they'll like you.
Thoma: You're an approachable person, and they can tell. Animals are very sensitive to these things.
Thoma: Just place some food here, and they'll come running.
