
(You go aask Kazuaki)

Kazuaki: This ninja dog you speak of... it rings a bell.
Kazuaki: Could I trouble you to describe it again for me?
 
Thoma: A red Shiba, with a scar on its eye, dressed in black stealth wear...
 
Kazuaki: Ah, I think I know. You must be talking about Inu Shoushou.

You: "Inu Shoushou"? Is that its name?

Kazuaki: That's right. I'm really surprised that's where you found him...
 
Thoma: Perfect! Now that we've figured out his identity, we can get its owner to go and collect it.
Thoma: I should add, it's never good to have dogs run away like this. The poor thing's out there all on his own with no real food or shelter, day and night.
Thoma: So, shall we go find the owner and see if they have time to fetch him?
 
Kazuaki: I'm sorry. That won't be possible.
 
Thoma: Why?
 
Kazuaki: I'm afraid I can't disclose the owner's identity.
Kazuaki: What I can tell you is they went out to sea on a dangerous mission, and... he won't be coming back.
Kazuaki: I had no idea that he hadn't taken Inu Shoushou along with him. Seems he decided to face this one alone.
Kazuaki: I can only assume that Inu Shoushou is waiting for his owner to come back, which is why he refuses to move from the beach...

You: But that means... Inu Shoushou will be waiting forever...

Thoma: Did Inu Shoushou's owner leave anything behind?
Thoma: You know, any personal items, or a Shuumatsuban uniform perhaps?

Kazuaki: Most of his possessions disappeared along with the man himself. The only thing I can think of is the Kunai he used to train with.
Kazuaki: Come with me. I'll see if I can find it for you.

(You search the warehouse with Kazuaki)

Kazuaki: Ah, yes, this looks like the one.
Kazuaki: The reason this Kunai stands out in my memory is because when he first joined the Shuumatsuban, he trained at it harder than anyone else, to the point where the tip became blunt from erosion.
Kazuaki: Take it. The Shuumatsuban will make sure to cover Inu Shoushou's daily expenses.
 
Thoma: Thank you kindly. Let's just hope Inu Shoushou remembers the scent of this Kunai... Then again, I'm certain he will.
Thoma: Let's go pay Inu Shoushou another visit, (Traveler).

(Keep the ninken company with Thoma)

Thoma: Hey, Inu Shoushou...
 
Inu Shoushou: Woof! ...Woof?
 
Thoma: I know, I know, how come this strange man suddenly knows your name?
Thoma: You're waiting for your master to come home, aren't you? Mind if we wait with you?
Thoma: Don't worry, we're not looking to suddenly whisk you away. Look at this, do you know what it is?

(Thoma shows you a kunai)
(A kunai that has lost its edge. You've heard that its user once used it while being put through a tough regimen.)

Inu Shoushou: Woof, woof! Woof!
 
Thoma: As I thought. You remember.

You: Inu Shoushou... He seems to be more affectionate this time.
 
Thoma: Excellent. It looks like what he needed wasn't for us to take him away, but for us to accompany him.
Thoma: You know, I sometimes did this too, when I first arrived in Inazuma. I just stood on the beach, looking out at the horizon.
Thoma: Everyone has people and events from their past that they look back on fondly. I guess we only grow when we realize that those things aren't coming back.
Thoma: The Shuumatsuban is not a peaceful organization, and being a ninja is an extremely dangerous profession.
Thoma: Many of the Shuumatsuban's ninjas have paid the ultimate price in the course of carrying out top-secret missions. The Shuumatsuban never discloses their identities, and doesn't publicly commemorate them.
Thoma: But at least now, Inu Shoushou, you're not the only one in the world who remembers him.
Thoma: From today onward, we will join you in honoring his memory.
 
Inu Shoushou: Woof...
 
Thoma: I think that means "deal," right?

You: It's a deal alright.

Thoma: Hey, in the future, let's try and come back here from time to time, when we get the chance.
Thoma: Maybe we could build a little kennel for him. In the long-term, being out in the cold and wet like this could start to cause joint problems.
Thoma: I could make some winter clothes for him, too. In fact, I'd better get started...
