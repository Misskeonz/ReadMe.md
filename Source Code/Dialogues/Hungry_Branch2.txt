You: Perhaps you should give it some time to calm down.
 
Thoma: That's a good idea.
Thoma: It was in a very aggressive mood the last time I saw it. I'm worried it might bite you if we tried to approach it, though.
Thoma: Let's wait until it's in need before going to its aid â€” that's probably safer.
Thoma: But back to our other animal friends. Now that the weather's getting colder, I'm wondering whether I should knit some sweaters for these strays.
Thoma: Problem is, most of them don't actually like being touched, so I can't take their measurements very easily.

You: We could photograph them?

Thoma: That's not a bad idea! We could take photos of them from different angles, then work out their measurements by using other objects in the picture as a reference...
Thoma: See, you're the real fixer here. Let's give it a try!
