Thoma heads to Komore Teahouse first. He seems to be preparing something...

Thoma: Oh, welcome! It must've been a while since you were last here.
Thoma: Since it's about time to eat, I couldn't resist whipping up a little something for us.
Thoma: So please, help yourself. Hope you enjoy it.
Thoma: And... I can't claim to compete with the likes of Uyuu Restaurant's chef, but I think I did alright.
Thoma: What's wrong? You look shocked!

You: After that hot pot game, I figured self-sabotage was your cooking style...

Thoma: Whoa, whoa, there's been a misunderstanding!
Thoma: I admit, I may have added a few weird things to that hot pot. But it was just a game!
Thoma: For normal meals, I cook normal dishes. I am a housekeeper, after all — wouldn't have gotten very far without a few culinary skills!
Thoma: Anyway, please dig in. I won't get the chance to cook for you like this every day.

You promptly polish off everything on the table.
 
Thoma: Well, seems like my cooking has your seal of approval.

You: Thanks for your hospitality.

Thoma: You're welcome. When you're out adventuring on your own, you've got to maintain your quality of life.
Thoma: Take your cape, for example. I definitely see one or two loose threads there.
Thoma: If you ignore them, sooner or later the whole seam is going to come undone, and then you'll have a really tough time mending it.
Thoma: Let me sew it up for you later — I'm pretty handy with a needle and thread.
Thoma: Speaking of housekeeping — I can say with confidence that you won't find anyone as handy around the home as I am.
Thoma: Cleaning, cooking, and mending are among my greatest strengths. You can always feel free to hand me jobs like this.

You: If this is your strength...

Thoma: Hmm? What is it?

You: You could run a housekeeping class for the Yashiro Commission!

Thoma: Wait... you're suggesting I teach housekeeping to the Yashiro Commission staff?
Thoma: I'm not sure it would work... I doubt anyone would sign up for that class.
Thoma: I just don't think it's realistic to change people's perception of me by showcasing my housekeeping skills... I'm surprised that whole matter is still troubling you, actually.
Thoma: With that being said, finding an opportunity to share some housekeeping wisdom with the Yashiro Commission would certainly be in people's best interests.
Thoma: Life maintenance is important. You have to look after yourself if you're going to bring your best self to your work.
Thoma: You know what? Let's give it a try! But first, how do you think I should promote it?
