Story Description
- You find the masterless ninken that Thoma mentioned, but its attitude is a bit...

(You look for ninkent that has wondered into the wild)

Thoma: Oh... see it? It's that one, just up ahead.
Thoma: Judging by the breed and apparel, it definitely is a ninja dog from the Shuumatsuban.
Thoma: It's looking a little more docile today. Shall we try and get closer?
Thoma: Oh, uh, you should stay a few paces behind me. I know it looks calm, but if it gets riled up, it could pounce and bite in an instant.
Thoma: Here doggy, good doggy... you hungry my friend? I brought you a nice little snack...
 
Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
 
Thoma: You're a vicious little thing, aren't you? You almost bit me again!
Thoma: Look at you, wasting away... you must wanna eat a little something?
Thoma: You don't have to come back with us, but c'mon — a dog's gotta eat, right?
Thoma: You're not worried it's poisoned, are you? Here, I'll take the first bite.
Thoma: See? Delicious and poison-free.

You: Thoma... You're really putting yourself out there...

Thoma: Come on, just have a bite. A little tiny bite, and then I'll leave you alone, how's that sound?
 
Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof!
 
Thoma: Looks like it has zero intention of eating the food we brought... Is it just me, or does it look kind of on edge?
Thoma: Maybe it's something in the sea... Or something nearby that's got him on alert.

You: Those monsters, perhaps?
 
Thoma: You think he was attacked by monsters... Hmm, it's possible.
 
Thoma: People do tend to lose their appetite in dangerous situations. Maybe it's the same for dogs, too. Let's clear out the area on behalf of our canine companion here.
Thoma: Thanks for helping out. This place should be a little more tranquil now, (Traveler).

(Observe the ninken's responses)
 
Thoma: Here doggy, look — no more danger.
Thoma: You've gotta wanna eat a little something now? Come on, eat up, then let's get you back to Komore Teahouse.
Thoma: Whatever's on your mind, you can tell me and Taroumaru all about it.
 
Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*

You: It still doesn't want to cooperate.
 
Thoma: *sigh* Rejected again.
Thoma: And there I was thinking that I was the one it didn't like. I didn't expect it to be so on edge around you, too.
Thoma: Well, to me, this proves that it simply doesn't want to leave this place. For now, let's not force it.
Thoma: Time to head back to the Yashiro Commission headquarters. I'll see if I can find its owner, so they can come and collect it.

You: But it's from the Shuumatsuban...
 
Thoma: That's right — the Shuumatsuban only answer to the Yashiro Commissioner, Kamisato Ayato. Under most circumstances, no one else has the authority to inquire into their business.
Thoma: However, I was talking to Commissioner Ayato a while back, and he agreed to let me bend the rules in exceptional circumstances.
Thoma: That doesn't mean I can mobilize the Shuumatsuban to do my bidding, of course. But I'll be able to get the intel we need, no problem. It's sort of a prerogative I have.
 
Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof, woof!
 
Thoma: Alright, there's a good dog, calm down. We're not gonna take you away.
Thoma: It's much safer here now, see? We're gonna leave now, make sure to give yourself a good rest.
Thoma: Alright, let's go.

(Talk to Ninken again)

Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
