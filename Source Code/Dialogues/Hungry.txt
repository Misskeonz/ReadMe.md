(Talk to Thoma)

Thoma: That didn't take long. Look at that, best buds already!
Thoma: Some of the dogs are even showing their bellies â€” that's a sign they really trust you.
Thoma: Well, you'll rarely see Taroumaru roll onto his back, though. He's a ninja dog, so he's always on guard in case an enemy approaches...
Thoma: Speaking of ninja dogs, I actually saw one the other day on the beach north of Konda Village.

You: Why would there be ninja dogs in the wild?
 
Thoma: That's the thing. They rarely go off on their own. Usually, they stick with their human ninja partners.
Thoma: After retiring, most ninja dogs are taken in by their partner. Or sometimes, someone else in the Yashiro Commission will take them in.
Thoma: It's extremely rare to find them on their own in the wild. So it makes me a little concerned.

You: Why don't you adopt it?

Thoma: Haha, believe me, I wanted to bring it back to the Yashiro Commission. But it wouldn't let me.
Thoma: I tried establishing some trust by petting it on the head, but it gave me a nasty bite.
Thoma: Still, I don't wanna give up on it... Nobody really goes out that way, and I don't know what it would have to eat out there.
