(Talk to Yasutake)

Yasutake: Ah, if it isn't Thoma!
Yasutake: I must say I'm surprised to see you. Last I heard you were in Ritou... then you just vanished into thin air.
Yasutake: Who's the new face?
 
Thoma: A friend.

Yasutake: "Friend"? What, uh, line of work is this fellow in, then?
 
Thoma: They're not a connection, if that's what you're thinking. Just a regular friend.
Thoma: No vested interests here. I originally wanted to take them out for some down time, but we've ended up mired in Commission-related complications.
 
Yasutake: Hahaha... Okay, I see, my mistake.
Yasutake: So, what's the situation today, then? I only ever see you when you need something.
 
Thoma: I remember last time we spoke, you were grumbling about a lack of Iron Ore. Have you made any progress on that front?
 
Yasutake: Why? You got any supplier recommendations?
Yasutake: You're a little out of the loop, my friend — we increased our bid price a while back. Soon after, we found plenty of sellers were pulling out all the stops to import stock from wherever they could get ahold of it.
Yasutake: I heard some people were so eager to get in on the action that they even took out loans to get ahead of the competition. If you were hoping to enter the bidding now... I'm afraid you're a little late to the party.
 
Thoma: Sounds like now you have the opposite problem — more Iron Ore than you know what to do with.
 
Yasutake: That's right, we're going to have to select a few sellers from the pool. There are certain candidates under consideration already, but we're still on the fence.
 
Thoma: I see. Well, would you mind if I gave you a couple of tips?
Thoma: As it happens, I'd noticed that shipments of Iron Ore had recently picked up. I looked into it a little, and managed to get a sense of which sellers had the quality stock, which offered competitive prices, and so on.
 
Yasutake: You don't say? Alright then, here's the list of sellers. Give me your thoughts.

Thoma: These two are veterans of the business. Regular sales, quality stock, but their price is a little steep. I think you could talk them down, though — I'd say to around 80% of what they've quoted you.
Thoma: This one sprung up out of nowhere recently in Ritou. Their approach is high volume, small profit margins. The quality's not too bad, but there's always a few duds, so you'd need to inspect the goods thoroughly upon receipt.
Thoma: This one grabbed a loan and leapt straight onto the bandwagon. In their haste, I fear they may have ended up with a mixed bag as far as quality is concerned. Given that their price isn't particularly competitive, either... I wouldn't consider them if I were you.
 
Yasutake: Wait, I know this name... Ah, yes. I believe we're on the same page here.
 
Thoma: Haha... To be completely up front, this is really quite important to me, so your help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.
 
Yasutake: Don't mention it, it's no skin off my back.
Yasutake: There is something I hope you could do for me in return, though. Recently, several of our deliveries of Iron Ore have been getting stolen. Is there anything you can do to help?
Yasutake: It's the worst on the road between Konda Village and Inazuma City... something always seems to happen along that stretch.
 
Thoma: No problem. We'll be back before you know it.

You: What is going on here...?

Thoma: I guess you have a few questions, (Traveler)... I'll explain everything later — but it looks like we'll need to get to work pretty soon.

(Talk to Yasutake again)

Yasutake: Thank you for helping look into the situation with our deliveries.

(Talk to Hironori)
 
Hironori: Argh, man this hurts... those monsters came out of nowhere..
Hironori: Thank you both for your help. Who are you...?
 
Thoma: Hi there. Yasutake commissioned us to come and assist with the delivery.
 
Hironori: Wonderful. I was starting to think I'd never get this Iron Ore to its destination.
Hironori: Um... so, do I owe you anything for this?
 
Thoma: Nope, this is between us and Yasutake.
Thoma: He's the one you should be thanking, if anyone.
Thoma: Alright, let's do this!

(After clearing first wave of enemies)


Thoma: Careful, there could be more monsters to come.



(After clearing second wave of enemies)


Thoma: Almost there now... one final push...


(After clearing third wave)

 Thoma: Alright, I think we can leave the goods here.
 
Hironori: Many thanks.
Hironori: There were so many monsters, I didn't even see where they came from... It was a dicey situation...
 
Thoma: The route should be safe from here on out. We'll be heading off now.
 
Hironori: Sure thing. Again, my thanks to both of you.
 
Thoma: All in a day's work. Come on, let's go, (Traveler).

(Report back to Yasutake)
 
Thoma: Worry no more, good sir, your goods have been safely delivered.
 
Yasutake: Good to know. As for the issue you needed my help with, I have someone on the case — you can expect a resolution very shortly.
Yasutake: You always seem to be cleaning up for other people behind the scenes, it must keep you pretty busy. Seems to eat up all of your personal time, too.
Yasutake: Speaking of... I'm going to need your help again in a few days time. There's a meeting coming up, and several trade associations will be fighting tooth and nail over the chance to make a profit. You'll have to mediate on this one.
 
Thoma: Ah, that rings a bell. Not a problem, I'll be there.
 
Yasutake: One other thing... I heard Sakai gave our guy a loan a while back. Just thought you might be interested to know.
 
Thoma: Is that so? Sounds like I should go talk to him, then. Thanks again for all your help, much obliged.
 
Yasutake: Think nothing of it. Goodbye for now, I'll see you in a few days' time.
(The person says goodbye and leaves.)

Thoma: Okay, this problem is halfway solved.

You: What were you talking about?

Thoma: That was the quartermaster of the Tenryou Commission. He's in charge of all their procurement, and also responsible for keeping their weapon supplies intact.
Thoma: Making weapons involves purchasing raw materials, so he's the key decision-maker in all the related trade in Iron Ore.
Thoma: The Iron Ore trade is actually what I was discussing with him just now.

You: But what does that have to do with ceremonial affairs...?

Thoma: On the surface, not a whole lot, I'll admit. But you'll see. Very shortly.
Thoma: But before that, time to go visit another old friend of mine.
