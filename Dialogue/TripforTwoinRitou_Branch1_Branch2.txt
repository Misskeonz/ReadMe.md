You: Your cooking is better.

Thoma: Haha... you flatter me.
Thoma: The store is at least a few decades old, and the chefs who make these have been at it their whole lives. Not sure my ability is on par with that...
Thoma: But if you're happy to be my taste-tester on a regular-enough basis, maybe one day I'll be able to reach their level.

Thoma: Okay, that about wraps up our nostalgia trip to the International Trade Association. I think we've just seen about everything there is to see in the city.
Thoma: Let's keep heading this way. We don't get to hang out all that often — it'd be a shame to head back so soon.

(Continue roam the streets with Thoma)

Thoma: With the change of seasons, Ritou gives me a different feeling each time I come.
Thoma: Hmm... maybe it's not entirely to do with the seasons. Anyway, the main point is, I'm happy to be here with you this time.

(You stop and talk to Thoma)

Thoma: I come to this place every time I visit Ritou.
Thoma: The view here isn't as spectacular as on Narukami Island, but if you're looking for a relaxing spot, you can't beat this one.

Thoma: I believe that the Sakoku Decree will be repealed one day, and this place will flourish again like it did in the old days.
Thoma: When the winds of freedom finally blow away the gloom... I think I'll have to ask milady for a long vacation, so I can take a trip back home.

Thoma: Alright, time to call it a day. Let's head back.

You: Hold on.

Thoma: Hmm? Not ready to leave yet?
Thoma: Come to think of it, I do have a couple more places I could take you...

You: I have a gift for you, too.

Thoma: Haha, there's no need for that.
Thoma: The whole reason I took you out was to thank you for all the help you gave us during the Vision Hunt Decree.
Thoma: As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's all I could ask for. You don't have to give me a gift.

You: But I think you'll like it.

Thoma: Really? Okay, well now I'm excited!
Thoma: Oh my... it's...

You: A little something from Mondstadt.

Thoma: ...
Thoma: This really... I wasn't expecting this.
Thoma: I'm a little lost for words... This gift is... invaluable.

You: It didn't cost anything...

Thoma: I know, but I don't mean its material value. I'm talking about its value to me specifically.
Thoma: Let me put it this way. The confectionery I received from that merchant earlier — thoughtful gift, don't get me wrong, but at the end of the day, I know it's mostly transactional.
Thoma: I helped him out, so it's standard procedure for him to get a gift for me in return. Also, he picked a brand of fancy confectionery that he thought would meet me at my level, and make it easier for him to approach me with any future requests.
Thoma: If you lend Mora to someone, you can guarantee that any gift you receive in return will have been chosen according to its material value.
Thoma: But the gift you just gave me can't be weighed in the same terms.

You: I'm just glad you like it.

Thoma: Okay, well... at least take this in return.
Thoma: It's an omamori I always carry with me. Again, nothing expensive.
Thoma: But it can bring the bearer good luck... seriously, I'm not making that up. My father told me.
Thoma: He gave it to my mom, and she gave it to me just before I came to Inazuma.
Thoma: Who knows, maybe this omamori was the only reason I survived the storm and made it to Inazuma in the first place.
Thoma: Whatever the truth of it is, I'd like you to have it.

(You received a Lucky Omamori from Thoma)

Hopefully, this omamori can bring you more good luck.
