Story Description
- You receive word of the latest crisis while trying to help Thoma win respect...


Thoma: So, have you had any ideas?

(You go ask Takashi)

Takashi: ...You're asking me what I think Thoma could do better?
Takashi: He's busy enough as it is, don't you think? I barely see him around here at the Commission.
Takashi: And when I do, more often than not, he's busy with the housework.
Takashi: I think he should carry on doing what he's doing. Everyone's got their own way of living, and Thoma's no different.

(You go ask Masanobu then)

Masanobu: Greetings, welcome to the Yashiro Commission.

You: About Thoma...
 
Masanobu: People have been talking about him behind his back? Surely not.
Masanobu: He does a wonderful job and always remains modest about it. Why would anyone single him out?
Masanobu: Huh, I can't figure it out. Try asking someone else.

(You ask Kiyoe next)
 
Kiyoe: Oh... Ugh, this is going to be a problem...

You: What's the matter?
 
Kiyoe: Oh... you're Miss Kamisato's friend, aren't you?
Kiyoe: Basically, something downright awful's happened, and we're discussing what on earth we should do about it...
Kiyoe: In preparation for the festival next month, we procured some very precious ceremonial implements from another island.
Kiyoe: But as luck would have it, our ship got hit by strong winds out at sea. The entire shipment is now sitting at the bottom of the ocean.

You: Do you have a backup plan?
 
Kiyoe: Well, certainly there's no time to go all the way back out there and buy another batch... Our only option is a gentleman based on Narukami Island by the name of Yuusaku.
Kiyoe: But he's a shrewd one. He caught on to the fact that we needed the goods urgently and raised prices sky-high.
Kiyoe: Clearly he wants to take us for every Mora we're worth — it's a real dilemma.

You: Can't you barter him down?

Kiyoe: We've tried, but he just won't budge. It doesn't help that he has something of a feud with the Yashiro Commision...
Kiyoe: He once sold us some ceremonial implements of exceptionally poor quality. We returned the items and exposed his malpractice in the process.
Kiyoe: He's resented us ever since. Now that he actually has the chance to get back at us, there's no way he'll back down.
Kiyoe: The Yashiro Commission doesn't have any direct authority over merchants. We could file a formal complaint, but the process is long and drawn out, and the festival is drawing nearer every day.

You: (It can't hurt to discuss this with Thoma...)

Kiyoe: Kazumasa and Furusawa have marched off to see him, but I don't know whether they'll be able to resolve it.
Kiyoe: I really hope the festival goes smoothly...

(Talk to Kiyoe again)

 Kiyoe: I really hope the festival goes smoothly...

(Tell Thoma of the Yashiro Commission emergency)

Thoma: ...Oh, that whole situation, huh.
Thoma: I heard a thing or two about it. I was planning on finding some time to sort it out after entertaining you.

You: So you know a solution?

Thoma: It's hard to say for sure. I'd need to talk with the guy first.
Thoma: Since this has piqued your interest — how about we head over there together?
Thoma: Still... the original plan here was to focus on your enjoyment, not rope you into the trials and tribulations of the Yashiro Commission

You: I want people to give you the respect you deserve.

Thoma: Ah, so that's your goal here.
Thoma: Well, if that is what you really want, I'd better give this my best shot.

You: Trials and tribulations with Thoma are bound to be fun!

Thoma: Oh? You think so?
Thoma: Well, in that case, I guess I'd better look alive!
Thoma: C'mon then, let's get ourselves over to Yuusaku and see what's what.
Thoma: I got some intel on him once before. At this time of day, he should be downtown in Inazuma City.

(Talk to Yuusaku)
 
Kazumasa: Your asking price just isn't realistic. What point are you trying to make here, huh?
Furusawa: If the festival gets delayed, don't say we didn't warn you!
Yuusaku: *clears throat*...
Yuusaku: Help!!! I'm being attacked by Yashiro samurai!
Kazumasa: What!? Hey, cut that out!
Furusawa: You little... Ahem, t—take it easy, would you? Look, we're not going to harm you, alright?
Yuusaku: The Yashiro Commission is forcing me to sell against my will! Doushin! I need a Doushin!
Kazumasa: Tsk, looks like there's no negotiation to be had here. Come on, let's get out of here!
Furusawa: Wait up...

(Furusawa and Kazumasa leave)

Yuusaku: Hmph, is that all they got? Amateurs. The nerve... Oh, hello... you're...

Thoma: Hello again.

Yuusaku: Wait, I know you! Well, if it isn't the Yashiro Commission's errand boy — Thoma!
Yuusaku: Do you know how long the Tenryou Commission locked me up for? And all thanks to you, going on about my goods being cheap fakes!
Thoma: You almost make it sound like I planted something and framed you. Those goods were defective, you know that, right?
Yuusaku: Ugh, you're so pedantic! Think how many festivals there are in a given year. Now take candles, for example — do you have any idea how many they go through? I could switch half of them out for duds without a single person noticing, and make a small fortune in the process...
Yuusaku: I was happily providing you with some much-needed supplies. Not only were you ungrateful, you had the audacity to report me.
Yuusaku: Well, now the tables have finally turned and you're begging for my help. Can you really blame me for charging a little extra?

You: This is more than a "little" extra...

Yuusaku: Look, I found out what happened. The Commission's shipment ran into a storm and is now lying at the bottom of the ocean.
Yuusaku: The festival's right around the corner, so postponing it isn't an option. Right now, I'm the only one selling what you need...
Yuusaku: If the festival goes pear-shaped and Guuji Yae or the Almighty Shogun hears about it, they are not going to be happy... and then you'll have a real problem on your hands.
Yuusaku: So you might want to consider your position here!
 
Thoma: C'mon boss, this is all a little heartless. Besides, aside from the Yashiro Commission, no one else buys ceremonial items. Surely resolving this dispute swiftly is in your interest too?
 
Yuusaku: Don't give me that. The fact is, you're desperate to buy, and I ain't desperate to sell.
Yuusaku: The batch I have here can go to waste for all I care — it'd be no great loss.
 
Thoma: Looks like we can't come to an agreement, then...
 
Yuusaku: Well, I'm glad it's dawning on you. You can either pay up, or look like a bunch of idiots when the festival comes around. Your choice!
Yuusaku: *sigh* Time's precious, and I've given you a fair slice of mine today. When you're ready to pay, I'll be ready to talk.
Yuusaku turns and leaves, without looking back
 
Thoma: *sigh*

You: He already left...

Thoma: Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that he doesn't intend to discuss this any further.
Thoma: I guess his time in the Police Station didn't make for happy memories.

You: Do you want me to mention this to the Raiden Shogun?

Thoma: No need.
Thoma: I can't say I think much of the way Yuusaku is acting... but ultimately, the issue here lies with the Yashiro Commission.
Thoma: We were the ones who lost the goods, so the responsibility is on us to find a solution. Otherwise, even if we ride this out, the Yashiro Commission's reputation will take a huge hit.
Thoma: Let's go. There are a few people I want to introduce you to.
