Story Description:
- Help Thoma advertise his housekeeping course at the Yashiro Commission to attract even more people to come.



(Talk to Hirano)
You tell Hirano about the housekeeping class...

Hirano: Housekeeping, you say...
Hirano: You know, since it's Thoma teaching, I'd definitely be up for going.
Hirano: Unfortunately, I have quite a lot going on over the next couple of days... but could I swing by once my schedule's freed up? I'd definitely like to give it a try.
 
Thoma: No problem at all. You can join whenever you like.
 
Hirano: Thanks, Thoma!
Hirano: Also, this isn't really my place, but if you're starting a housekeeping class — haven't you thought about asking Furuta?
Hirano: As the Kamisato Clan's butler, I'm sure she'd know a lot about housekeeping.

You: Sounds like someone we should speak to.

Thoma: Sure, let's go pay her a visit.
Thoma: Let's hope this goes smoothly...

(Talk to Furuta)

Furuta: Ah, Thoma and a guest. This is a rare combination.
Furuta: Has something happened?

Thoma: Not at all! We were just... thinking of starting a housekeeping class.
 
Furuta: A housekeeping class? How wonderful. Do you know, I've always wanted to have Koharu learn from you. Finally, the time has come.
Furuta: I'm guessing you intend to open the class up to the whole Yashiro Commission? Not just housekeeping staff and servants, right?
Furuta: In which case, why don't you do a big spring-clean of the Commission itself? It would be a great way to showcase your methods.
Furuta: Seeing is believing, after all. You could spend a long time trying to convince them with words alone — or you could let them see you in action with their own eyes.

You: Sounds like a good idea, actually...

Thoma: I like Furuta's suggestion, and it's not like we have a better idea anyway.
Thoma: In which case, heck, why not — let's showcase the appeal of housekeeping for all in the Yashiro Commission to see!
Thoma: Let's get started, (Traveler)!

(The big cleanup attracts onlookers from the Yashiro Commission)

(After clearing 3 bushes)

Thoma: ...And the flowers will really flourish now that the weeds are gone.

(After clearing all bushes)

Thoma: While we're here, though, we should water the trees.

(After completing the challenge)

Thoma: Whew... the whole Yashiro Commission looks as good as new.
Thoma: We had a lot of spectators, huh. I wonder if we managed to get any of them interested.
Thoma: Either way, thanks for your help, (Traveler).
Thoma: I usually handle all of this stuff on my own. Having you join me today was a pretty great experience.

You: It's nothing.

Thoma: Here's hoping! I'll set out some tables and chairs tonight. I've got no idea how many people will show up tomorrow.
Thoma: Make sure you get some good rest tonight. I'll see you tomorrow!

(Go to the Yashiro Commission to take part in the housekeeping course)
 
Thoma: Welcome, (Traveler)!

You: Not many people have showed up...
 
Thoma: Haha, don't be too upset. This is normal.
Thoma: With things like this, you can't expect to change people's views overnight. It takes time and effort.
Thoma: Well then, looks like I'm all yours for this class. I mentioned earlier about sewing up your clothes for you, didn't I?
Thoma: I also want to take this opportunity to teach you how to knit a sweater. That way, you'll be able to make yourself some warm clothes before the winter comes.

You: I didn't manage to get you the respect you deserved...

Thoma: Haha, the fact that you're so ready to look out for me has already made me very happy.
Thoma: But really, it doesn't bother me at all. Once in a while, someone takes issue with my background, interests, or the nature of my work, and that's okay. You can't expect everyone in life to see things the way you do.
Thoma: People are always going to talk. It's in their nature, and you can't do much to stop them. I don't mind what they say about me — what I care about is the wellbeing of the Kamisato Clan.
Thoma: But that's enough about all that. Come on, grab your needle and let's get knitting.
Thoma: Let's start with a classic stockinette stitch. First, wrap the yarn around, pull it through here, then hang it on the needle...
Thoma: Put your thumb on the yarn here, index finger here, and pull it tight.

You: Like this?

Thoma: You learn pretty quick! But you need to pay close attention to this...
Thoma: Exactly, just like that. Now, set yourself a small goal to start with, for example, knit a scarf by the time winter arrives.
Thoma: Scarves are always a great choice. When it's finished, you can either wear it yourself, or gift it to a friend!
Thoma: Just imagining it warms my heart.

Knitting a sweater is harder than one might imagine.
