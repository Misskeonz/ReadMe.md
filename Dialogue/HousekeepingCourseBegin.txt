(Return to the Yashiro Commission to make final preparations)
 
Thoma: To be honest, with this being my first time holding a class, I've got no idea how many people to expect.
Thoma: I just hope it goes well. Anyway, tonight I'll set up the tables and chairs, then tomorrow we can meet back at the Yashiro Commission headquarters.
Thoma: So, what do you think the turnout will be like, (Traveler)?

You: I'm sure lots of people will come.

Thoma: I sure hope so. We promoted it pretty hard, after all.
Thoma: This is the weirdest feeling. Housekeeping has always been something I do alone, but now I'm about to face a class full of students.
Thoma: You'd better show up to class tomorrow!

You: I'm not super optimistic...

Thoma: Haha, truth be told, I'm a little nervous myself.
Thoma: But I'm sure it will turn out okay. We put in the legwork, after all.
Thoma: Guess we'll have to wait and see what tomorrow brings. As for tonight, I need a good rest.
Thoma: See you tomorrow, (Traveler)!

(Go to the Yashiro Commission to take part in the housekeeping course)

Thoma: Welcome, one and all. This is my first time teaching a housekeeping class, just as, I'm sure, it's your first time attending one.
Thoma: I'd like to start from the theory, if I may, and talk a little bit about why mastering the discipline of housekeeping is such an important thing.
Ogura Mio: Quick, come in, Thoma's started the class already.

You: There's so many people...

Ogura Mio: Well, of course. No one's ever held a class like this in the past.
Ogura Mio: I saved you a place. Please take a seat.

Thoma: The way I see it, housekeeping is a unique skillset that empowers you to set your life in order.
Thoma: Nowhere are these skills more pertinent than in the context of a marital relationship. In a marriage, the lives of two people become closely intertwined.
Thoma: If you can't look after yourself properly, that burden ends up being shouldered by your partner. This, in turn, will start to take a toll upon the relationship...
Thoma: Umm... huh, what are you doing here?
 
Kazumasa: What the...
Furusawa: Huh?
Yuuko: I brought him. Didn't you say men can study housekeeping too?
Yuuri: Wipe that look off your face! Aren't you going to greet the teacher?
Kazumasa: No, it's... I...
Yuuko: Darling?
Kazumasa: H—Hello, teacher.
Furusawa: For the love of... Hello, teacher.
 
Thoma: Well hello, and welcome. Now that you're here, I expect you to pay attention and work hard.
Thoma: Well, let's keep going. Housekeeping is not difficult per se — the difficult part is consistency: keeping on top of it over a long stretch of time.
Thoma: To keep up with housework on an ongoing basis, you either have to love everything about it, or you need a few tricks up your sleeve to make things easier. So, for today's topic, we're going to focus on "How to make light work... of housework!"

You: (So far so good.)

Thoma: Excuse me, you over there. Focus, please.

(The camera pans to Traveler, who looks dozing off)

Thoma: I like to see active engagement in my lessons.
Thoma: That is unless some of you are looking to stay behind after class to catch up...

Active engagement, that's what you like to see!
