You: Let's head out.

Thoma: You want to go out for a stroll? Perfect, I have a couple of places You: I was going to recommend.

Thoma: If you like cats and dogs, there's a great place I can take you.
Thoma: I go there pretty much every time I have a day off. You can't help but be in a good mood when you're surrounded by cute animals.
Thoma: Failing that, we could go downtown if you'd prefer?
Thoma: Narukami Island will be packed right now, so we could go to Ritou instead.
Thoma: Hehe, back to where we first met. I haven't been there in a long time, actually.
Thoma: Which one are you feeling? It's up to you.
