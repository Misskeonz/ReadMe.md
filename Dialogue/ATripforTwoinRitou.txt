You have a relaxing time together with Thoma in Ritou.


(You talk to Thoma)

Thoma: I haven't been to Ritou in a long time, but it feels like the place hasn't changed at all.
Thoma: Then again, a long time for humans is a blink of an eye for the natural environment.
Thoma: Makes me wonder... what is Mondstadt like these days?

You: Wait, you've been to Mondstadt?

Thoma: Yeah. I actually grew up there.
Thoma: Later, my father moved back to Inazuma, and then we never heard from him. I wanted to take him some Dandelion Wine, so I took the boat here from Mondstadt.
Thoma: Unfortunately, we hit a huge storm on the way, which sank the boat. I fell unconscious, but was somehow lucky enough to float the rest of the way to Inazuma on debris from the wreckage.
Thoma: I'll spare you the rest for now. Lemme take you around.
Thoma: This is a branch of the Chuyu Trading Company, based in Liyue. They sell ore from that region.
Thoma: I'm guessing you would have seen shops that look like this over there?

You: Yes, I have.

Qiuyue: Ah, hello there. What brings the two of you all the way out to Ritou today?
Qiuyue: Since you're here, you should pick out a special something. We've got some fantastic pieces in at the moment.
Qiuyue: Like this Noctilucous Jade Necklace, or this Cor Lapis Bracelet. They may not be top tier in terms of ore quality, but the craftsmanship is simply exquisite.
Qiuyue: Do either of them pique your interest?

You: Maybe the bracelet would suit me better?

Thoma: I think both suit you very nicely.
Thoma: To heck with it — how often do we get to do this? We'll take them both.
Thoma: But you've gotta be fair to us with the price, Ma'am. My friend here is actually from Liyue.
Qiuyue: Oh, really? Well, say no more, Thoma, I wouldn't dream of overcharging. How does this figure look to you?
Thoma: It looks very reasonable. Deal! Now, lemme take you somewhere else.

(You roam the streets with Thoma...)

Thoma: Back in its heyday, Ritou always used to remind me of Mondstadt...
Thoma: Freedom of trade, freedom of culture, and freedom of lifestyle.

Thoma: This is Sailing Breeze, a purveyor of Mondstadt wines.
Thoma: As it turned out, one of the first things that greeted me here when I arrived wasn't my father, but wine from my hometown.Thoma: It must be said though, the wines here aren't quite up to the Dawn Winery standard...
Thoma: Back when my father was still in Mondstadt, he used to talk fondly of the Angel's Share.
Thoma: Of course, I was still a kid back then, so I never did get to join him for a drink.
Thoma: And now that I'm actually old enough, the opportunity is gone...

You: You'll get the chance one day.

Thoma: I hope so.
Thoma: You've been to Mondstadt, right? I assume you've been to the Angel's Share?
Thoma: I hear the owner's quite a formidable businessman. Given the chance, I'd love to meet him.
Thoma: When that day comes, we should also grab a drink... ah, wait, what am I saying. Maybe when you're older.

(You continue roam the street with Thoma...)

Thoma: Ritou's been going downhill ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect.
Thoma: The winds of freedom disappeared and a dark gloom took their place.
Thoma: Ironically, though, it's that same gloom that really allows me to thrive here...
Kaede: Hi, Thoma. Out shopping with your friend? Can I get you anything today?
Thoma: Why not — I'll take that Toy Fox.
Thoma: The Sakoku Decree has not been good for business.
Thoma: Merchants have faced hostility at every turn. That's why the International Trade Association got together...

(Both of you go to the International Trade Association entrance)

Thoma: Here we are. Bet this takes you back, huh?
