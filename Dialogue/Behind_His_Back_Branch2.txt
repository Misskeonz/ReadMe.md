You: Sorry, I can't say I agree.
Thoma: Oh?
You: It makes me uncomfortable.

Thoma: I'm touched that that's how you see the situation.
Thoma: I don't think we need to go down that route, though... in any case, as a housekeeper, it's hardly my place to get all high and mighty with other staff in the Yashiro Commission.
Thoma: But you're my guest and I live to serve, so if you have any other thoughts on the matter, please do share them with me.
Thoma: I'm willing to give anything you suggest a shot â€” as long as it's a serious suggestion, of course.
You: (I'll ask around at the Yashiro Commission...)
Thoma: I'll be waiting for you right here. Just come and find me if you need anything.
