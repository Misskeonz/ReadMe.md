Story Description
- You meet up with Thoma again, and he brings the finished sweater.


Thoma: Ahh, they're so cute... Come on, let's take some photos.

(You take pictures of the strays with different angles)

Thoma: Well, I think we've got enough photos now.
 Thoma: I can't get over how cute they are! They're just adorable, aren't they?
