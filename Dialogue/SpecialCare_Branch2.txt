You: They're a pain in the butt.
 
Thoma: Haha, you mean because they won't keep still?
Thoma: In their defense, they've not really had proper training. It's natural for them to want to move around.

Thoma: You know, the first time I came here, there was just one stray dog on its own.
Thoma: I still remember the first time I fed it. It was a rainy day.
Thoma: The Kamisato Clan had just introduced a series of new policies, but a few of the more stubborn clan elders were extremely resistant to the changes.
Thoma: I was holding my umbrella, on my way to visit one such gentleman of senior status. The plan was to talk him into supporting the clan's decision.
Thoma: Sadly, he wasn't interested in having a conversation — he didn't even let me in. As soon as he saw me coming, he got his samurai to send me away.

You: Some things even Thoma can't fix, huh?
 
Thoma: I mean, I fixed it in the end of course. It's just that the first few visits didn't go so smoothly.
Thoma: So anyway, after they turned me away, the weather went from bad to worse. The wind was so strong it rendered my umbrella completely useless... Before long, I was drenched from head to toe — I must have looked like a real mess.
Thoma: I decided to take shelter under a tree, and found a stray dog sitting there who had the same idea as me.
Thoma: It saw me and moved a little further in, like it was trying to make room for me.
Thoma: So, we sat there together. I shared my Onigiri with it — stone cold by this point, but still edible — and we ended up huddling together, waiting for the rain to stop.
Thoma: As far as the big shots are concerned, I'm just an expendable servant boy. I always have to be mindful about what they might want, and what I can do for them in return.
Thoma: But when I'm with these little guys and gals, everything's so much simpler. One stone-cold Onigiri, and hey presto. We're friends for life.
Thoma: Even when I show up empty-handed, they still come to me. When it comes down to it, I think it's these simple and straightforward connections that I value the most.
Thoma: Sorry, ended up giving you the unabridged version! Shall we come visit this place again some other time?

You: As soon as you've done your knitting!
 
Thoma: Great. I'll see you soon!

(You meet with Thoma at the same place the next day...)


(You dress the stray cats and dogs in sweaters with Thoma)

Thoma: *yawn* So sleepy...
Thoma: I had some things I needed to do, so I ended up burning the midnight oil to get those sweaters knitted.
Thoma: I wonder if they'll actually suit them though... Hmm, let's start by testing them out on the friendlier ones, (Traveler).
Thoma: This one's for Petal, this one's for Darko, and this one's for Goldilocks...

You: Nice job.
 
Thoma: With any luck, that should see them through the winter.
Thoma: Then, come the spring, a new year will begin...
Thoma: ...and they'll be free to roam the wilds once again.
Thoma: You know, if you take one day at a time and be kind to the world, good things will come your way eventually.
Thoma: That might sound a bit naive, but I really do believe it.
Thoma: At least... it seems to have worked for me, you know?

Thoma knits sweaters for the stray cats and dogs, but it seems that one doesn't quite fit.
