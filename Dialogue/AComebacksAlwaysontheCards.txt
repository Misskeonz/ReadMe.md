(Talk to Sakai)

Sakai: Ah, Thoma. You too?
Sakai: Yasutake sent someone over already. But I'm telling you, Thoma, I just don't know if it's feasible.
 
Thoma: Really? Why, is there a problem?
 
Sakai: You betcha. The guy owes me Mora, for sure, but there's a long repayment period on that loan. If I go hounding him for Mora now, that makes me the bad guy.
 
Thoma: But as I recall, the only reason he was entitled to such a long period was because at the outset, he had a business relationship with the Yashiro Commission.
Thoma: So, if we sever ties with him, surely he'd have to pay you back right away.
 
Sakai: In principle, that's how it works. But I'd still be the one who has to take all the flak.
Sakai: I'm just a small-timer, you know? People like me need stability and security, not to go rocking the boat...
 
Thoma: C'mon now, let's work something out. Weren't you after some Noctilucous Jade last time we spoke? We can put our heads together and get hold of some for you.
 
Sakai: Hmm... Well, Noctilucous Jade would be good for starters, but...
 
Thoma: For starters? I'd say that's plenty for now... You don't want to go biting off more than you can chew, right?
 
Sakai: You... okay, fine.
Sakai: If you bring me some Noctilucous Jade, I'll get my hands dirty for you!
 
Thoma: Great. Alright, let's go and find some, (Traveler).

(Report back to Sakai)
 
Thoma: Okay, is this enough?
 
Sakai: Plenty. Leave the rest to me, I promise you'll be satisfied customers.
Sakai: You know Thoma, you haven't changed one bit. Same mindset, same style of working.
Sakai: I sure hope the two of us never get into a conflict. Fingers crossed our cooperation will stay happy and healthy for a long time to come.
 
Thoma: Don't you worry, unless you've got plans to cause trouble for the Yashiro Commission, the future looks bright for all our future dealings.
 
Sakai: Phew, that's good to hear. Okay, I'll be seeing you, folks.

You: Can we really trust this guy?

Thoma: Don't worry.
Thoma: People whose attention is always focused on other people's weaknesses tend to expose their own weaknesses pretty easily.
Thoma: Let's head back to the Yashiro Commission headquarters.

(Return to the Yashiro Commission)
 
Kazumasa: *sigh*... What do we do now?
Furusawa: We could try... asking him nicely? Maybe he'd have a change of heart?
Kazumasa: I highly doubt that would work...
Kazumasa: Then again, since we don't have any other options, we might as well give it a try.
Furusawa: But the samurai spirit...
Kazumasa: We serve the head of the clan. If the clan is in trouble, we must bear whatever humiliation comes our way to resolve the situation. This, too, is the samurai spirit!

(Yuusaku runs in)
 
Yuusaku: Phew... Uh, i—is anyone there?
Kazumasa: Huh, what's he doing here?
Furusawa: He must be here to make fun of us.
Kazumasa: There's nothin' we can do about it. Brace yourself...
Kazumasa: I apologize![Note 1]
Yuusaku: I apologize!
Kazumasa: ...Huh?
Yuusaku: I apologize! Forgive me, I'll sell to you at the original price... no, what am I saying, make that half price!
Kazumasa: What's going on here?
Yuusaku: Thoma? Thoma, are you here?
Yuusaku: I was completely in the wrong. However much you need, I'll sell it to you. I've got a warehouse full of stock, too, if you need more. Please, you'll have everything you could need!
 
Thoma: ...And without any duds this time, I assume?
 
Yuusaku: None, none whatsoever! I'll stake my whole reputation on it — no fakes, no defects! I give you my word!
Yuusaku: P—Please, this is my whole livelihood... don't cut me off...
 
Thoma: Since you've promised not to sneak in any fakes this time around, go ahead with the shipment. Once we've inspected the goods, and if all's in order, I'm sure whatever problems you're presently facing will quickly disappear.

Yuusaku: Okay, I'll deliver the goods right away! Right away, I promise...
 
Thoma: You see what I mean? Getting things settled as soon as possible is in everyone's best interests.
Thoma: *sigh*... Alright, with that taken care of, let's get out of here.

(Thoma swiftly disappears)
 
Kazumasa: Why was he apologizing... to Thoma?
Furusawa: What's going on here? Hey, Thoma...
Furusawa: That's strange, where'd he go? He was right here a second ago...

(You find Thoma in the corridor, sweeping...)

Thoma: Okay, the floors are done.
Thoma: Next, I need to dust down the railings...
Thoma: I only took one day off, but look how much dust has gathered. This is what I mean when I say cleaning is a daily chore.

You: Just now... what happened?
 
Thoma: You remember what he said, don't you? His goods could go unsold, and it wouldn't bother him.
Thoma: So the solution in this case was to cut off his main line of business, and make him really feel the heat.
Thoma: The Yashiro Commission doesn't have the authority to meddle in the business world. But, as it happened, I knew a few of his major customers, so I sorted it out privately.
Thoma: When he realized he couldn't shift his product, had no source of revenue, and wouldn't be able to pay off his loan... he suddenly felt the pressure.
Thoma: Then, I just had to make sure he caught wind of what the cause of his problems was, so he'd seek us out to make an apology.

You: Sounds like you gave him the full Thoma treatment.

Thoma: It's no big deal. I've dealt with plenty of situations like this in the past.
Thoma: I know you'd like people to look up to me more, but... it doesn't bother me all that much.
Thoma: I'm just the housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan — reputation isn't all that important to me. On the contrary, having too good of a reputation can be restrictive.
Thoma: You feel indignant for my sake when you hear people spreading gossip about me, don't you? That says that in your mind, I'm not the kind of person they say I am.
Thoma: For me, that's enough. All I need is for the people I'm close with to know the real me.
Thoma: Thanks for your help in averting a potential crisis for the Yashiro Commission. I owe you one! I'll have to entertain you again some time.
Thoma: Ah, plus I didn't get very far with entertaining you this time around... so, I guess I owe the both you!
